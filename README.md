***What is this?***

I got tired of losing this file so I am putting it here. This is a macro for the game Stardew Valley (2016).

***What does this do?***

In Stardew Valley, players are able to animation cancel their actions by pressing Right-Shift + Del + R. This macro executes the animation cancel.

***How does it work?***

You can enable/disable the macro in-game using Left-Control. While the macro is active, pressing Space will execute an action and then animation cancel it.
